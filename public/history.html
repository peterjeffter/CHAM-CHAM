    <h4>HISTORY OF CHAMCHAM</h4>
    <p class="info">
When I had my daughter, I fully expected her to develop as quickly and as typically as other children. Unfortunately, though she met all other milestones, I soon realised that her speech which had started to develop suddenly stopped, and she seemed to stop understanding me when I spoke to her. By the time I put her in school it became even more obvious that there was something wrong with her speech development. Soon, she began to fall behind simply because the teachers could not cope with a non-verbal learner, and then I realised that she was not making friends, and always sought her own company instead of playing with other children.<br>
I took her to have her analysed and I was given the news that no parent wants to hear – ASD. <br>
I simply took this to mean that my daughter needed a bit more help than other children, and so I stayed home to home school her. <br>
Over the course of a few months, she began to speak more words and be a lot friendlier and social, and I noticed that there was presence and intelligence in her eyes. I discovered that her many outbursts were actually expressions of her frustration because she could not articulate her needs, and so was not being cared for as she needed. So I persevered in teaching her and teaching myself to help her, and I realised that she needed opportunities to practice the words she did know, and to learn how to string them into sentences. <br>
Then I came up with the idea for an app that would allow her to see hundreds of fun, everyday scenarios long enough to give her mind time to find the words to describe what she was seeing. I teamed up with my brother and ChamCham was created. The more she practiced, the more she retained the use of the words she learned, and the more she used them in real life.<br>
I believe that this app will be of great benefit to those learners who suffer from language delay, those on the autism spectrum, and even adults who are trying to recover their speech after a stroke or other traumatic incident.
I have put a user fee on it simply because now that I am a stay-at-home mom, I need the income to keep us going. I’m just glad that my efforts will help as many people as are in this predicament, and I would be glad if even a single person will look back one day and say my app was instrumental in helping him achieve speech.
