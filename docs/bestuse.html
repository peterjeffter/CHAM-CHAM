    <h3>Best use of CHAMCHAM!</h3>
    <p class="info">
The app is best used by the learner with the leading of the caregiver so as to ensure that he is actually speaking and <br>not falling back to incoherence. The caregiver is expected to patiently guide the learner, pointing out the activitie<br> going on and verbalising them to slowly and articulately using short simple sentences as much as possible, <br>while encouraging the learner to do the same until the learner easily expresses himself in level  several or all of <br>the scenes. At that time a higher difficulty level should be chosen.<br>
Every time the caregiver is satisfied with the learner’s attempts, he utters the prompt clearly from the list of prompts, <br>or the particular phrase which he himself has saved on the app. Once the app recognises this phrase, the learner gets to watch a little animation as a reward, and a random scene will be generated. <br>
The app can be used by persons of any language, since the app does not decide the rightness or wrongness of the learner’s <br>utterances. That is for the caregiver to decide.<br>
The professional caregiver only needs to download the app once, and up to three learners can be registered on his <br>account. Registering additional learners will require an additional subscription.<br>
